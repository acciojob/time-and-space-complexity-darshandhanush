	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size. It's efficient is it is an essential factor in determining the performance and scalability of a program, as inefficient algorithms can lead to slow execution times and unresponsive applications.</p>
	<p>Overall time complexity of Merge sort is O(nLogn). It is more efficient as it is in worst case also the runtime is O(nlogn) The<b>Space Complexity</b> of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of space and may slower down operations for the last data sets .</p>
